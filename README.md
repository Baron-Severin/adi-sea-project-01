#### Overview

Let's put your Java knowledge to good use! You have just heard word that Dianna LOVES your new program. So much so, that she's planning on using it in her new marketing campaign! You're tasked, as the voice of your generation, of making the brand speak to the youth of today. After a round of internet polls, a game seemed like the most appealing solution, so you set out to create your new masterpiece. Dianna only has a few requests:

- The game must contain the inventory of the store! We need to advertise!
- The game must use at least one hashmap. Dianna has heard good things about hashmaps from her grandson, so I guess we have to use them.
- Provide instructions on how to play your game.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

- Have a main menu with the function of the previous lab:
  - If the user enters "play", they should be able to play Dianna's game against the computer
  - Provide instructions on how to play the game
  - Should use the inventory from the store in the game
  - If the user enters "history", the program should display previous game history
- Handle invalid user input
- Use a hashmap

**Bonus:**

- Store game history/inventory across sessions

#### Code of Conduct

As always, your app must adhere to General Assembly's [student code of conduct guidelines](../../../resources/guidelines/code-of-conduct.md).

If you have questions about whether or not your work adheres to these guidelines, please speak with a member of your instructional team.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Based on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 8 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
